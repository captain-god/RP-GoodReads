{"name":"Rp-goodreads","tagline":"Small (tiny) Garry's Mod addon that adds signs to the game that users can write to and read from.","body":"#This is RP GoodReads.  \r\nI made this mod because I wanted to have books and signs in the game that people could read. The main influence came from darkRP's notes system, which I loved the idea of, but hated the execution. Then I got to thinking: what if we could have like signs with the text just printed onto them? I saw a couple of mods print text to props and entities, so I figured it wouldnt be that hard. I went right to work. \r\n\r\n#Current Version:  \r\nBeta 1.1  \r\n[![Beta 1.1 Release](http://img.youtube.com/vi/wnj8hJZpLSo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnj8hJZpLSo)\r\n\r\n##How to install from github\r\n1. download the file from [here](https://github.com/dougRiss/RP-GoodReads/archive/master.zip)\r\n2. navigate to your garry's mod addons folder\r\n3. unzip the downloaded file to a folder in the addons directory.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
