#This is RP GoodReads.  
I made this mod because I wanted to have books and signs in the game that people could read. The main influence came from darkRP's notes system, which I loved the idea of, but hated the execution. Then I got to thinking: what if we could have like signs with the text just printed onto them? I saw a couple of mods print text to props and entities, so I figured it wouldnt be that hard. I went right to work.
