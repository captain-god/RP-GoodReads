#Good Reads
Rp Good Reads' intended purpose was to include readables into an RP server (because darkRP's notes were just awful). The idea began as signs, then it shaped itself into signs and books, then just readables altogether. The inspiration came from darkRP's Check module, where the check is displayed on the physical prop. I thought, "oh fuck, imagine that, but on a sign or piece of paper like a menu."
