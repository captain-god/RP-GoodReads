Intent here is to clean up code and make it more readable. I want this to be open sourced, and that's gonna be difficult if it's totally illegible. Once the code is desireably clean, config is set up, and sticky notes are finished, it will go to release.

#Presently, I am redoing basically everything about the mod. i know this is probably going to be my downfall, so I'm gonna work on both versions at the same time. I'll release as soon as I can get it out, then focus solely on the new version.
