#Presently, I am redoing basically everything about the mod. i know this is probably going to be my downfall, and that's why I branched instead of overwrote. I'm gonna work on both versions at the same time. I'll release master as soon as I can get it out, then focus solely on the new version (this branch).

##How to install from github
1. download the file from [here](https://github.com/dougRiss/RP-GoodReads/archive/master.zip)
2. navigate to your garry's mod addons folder
3. unzip the downloaded file to a folder in the addons directory.
4. load the game.
